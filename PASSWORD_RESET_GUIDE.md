## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Supabase Email Settings
Make sure your Supabase project has email settings configured:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication → Email Templates
3. Customize the "Reset Password" email template if needed
4. Ensure SMTP settings are configured (or use Supabase's default)

### Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env.local` file has the correct Supabase URL:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

## 🎯 User Flow

1. **User forgets password** → Clicks "Forgot your password?"
2. **Enters email** → Requests reset link
3. **Receives email** → Clicks reset link
4. **Sets new password** → Confirms new password
5. **Returns to login** → Signs in with new password

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **Secure tokens**: Uses Supabase's secure token system
- **Time-limited links**: Reset links expire automatically
- **One-time use**: Each reset link can only be used once
- **Password validation**: Ensures strong passwords
- **Session management**: Properly handles authentication state

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid reset link"**
   - Check if the email link is complete and not truncated
   - Ensure you're using the link within the time limit
   - Try requesting a new reset link

2. **"Password update failed"**
   - Ensure password meets minimum requirements (6+ characters)
   - Check if passwords match in both fields
   - Verify you're using the correct reset link

3. **Email not received**
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify email address is correct
   - Check Supabase email settings

4. **"Error setting session"**
   - This usually means the reset link has expired
   - Request a new password reset
